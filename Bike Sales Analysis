The Bike Sales Analysis Dashboard provides valuable insights into customer demographics, purchasing patterns, and factors influencing bike sales.

Customer Demographics and Key Metrics - The dataset consists of 1,000 customers, with an average income of 56,360 
and a total of 481 bikes sold. From these key numbers we can understand who is buying bikes and what factors are driving them to buy.

Income and Purchasing Behaviour- 
We can see that from the Bar Chart "income-wise bike purchases" reveals that individuals with higher incomes tend to buy more bikes. 
Both male and female buyers show a preference for bikes, but there is a visible variation in purchase volume across different income brackets,
like Clerical, Management, Manual, Professional and Skilled Manual (2nd Pie Chart).

Age and Gender Trends in Bike Purchases-
For analyzing age-wise purchases, from the 3rd Column Chart we can see that the 30-40 age group emerges as the most active buyers, 
followed by the 40-50 segment. The 20-30 age group also shows a decent number of purchases, but sales gradually decline among customers aged 50 and above.
Interestingly, males consistently purchase more bikes than females across all age groups.

Regional Preferences and Distance Factors-
Regionally, buyers in North America show higher purchase rates compared to other regions such as the Pacific and Europe (4th Bar Chart).
Distance from the purchase location also influences buying behavior (5th Column Chart).
Most purchases are made by customers living within 0-2 miles of the store, with sales decreasing significantly for those residing farther than 5 miles.

Education and Occupation Insights-
The education level of buyers plays a crucial role in purchasing decisions (6th Line Chart).
Those with higher education degrees, such as graduates, purchase more bikes, while individuals with partial high school education contribute less to sales.
Professionals and skilled manual workers show the highest purchasing power compared to those in clerical or management roles.

Influence of Homeownership and Marital Status (used as Slicers)-
Homeowners show a higher tendency to purchase bikes, whereas non-homeowners have relatively lower purchase rates.
Single individuals purchase more bikes compared to married customers, possibly due to different lifestyle preferences.

From the analysis, we can conclude that the ideal target audience for bike sales consists of:
1.	Individuals aged 30-50, especially males.
2.	Customers with higher income levels.
3.	Homeowners and single individuals.
4.	Buyers in North America within 0-2 miles of the store.
5.	Professionals and skilled manual workers.

To boost bike sales further, marketing efforts can focus on:
1. Expanding promotions to female customers to bridge the gender gap.
2. Targeting married customers with family-oriented biking options.
3. Increasing regional outreach beyond North America to untapped markets.
