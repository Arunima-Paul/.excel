Static and Interactive Data Analysis Dashboard in MS Excel.
These are my first data analysis dashboards.
The Amazon Prime dashboard is a static one, whereas the Bike Sales Dashboard is an interactive Excel dashboard.
Here data analysis by creating pivot tables and charts are shown. Slicers are used for interactive dashboard.
